## Introduction

G.U.I.D.E is a somewhat complex piece of software that is maintained by me in my spare time. As such, there are some constraints on how updates and support will be handled.  

## Updates

I will release updates to G.U.I.D.E as they are completed. These updates may include new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, or compatibility updates with future versions of Godot. Newer versions of G.U.I.D.E may require newer versions of Godot, so make sure to check the release notes for compatibility information. In general, the plugin will be updated to work with the latest stable version of Godot. 

G.U.I.D.E may not always be compatible with the latest development previews and betas of Godot. If you find an issue with a development version of Godot, please report it, so I can investigate and fix it. That being said, a fix might not be available right away as especially with development versions of Godot, things can change rapidly and this week's fix might be made obsolete by next week's development version of Godot.

At some point, support for older versions of Godot might be dropped if necessary to keep the codebase maintainable or take advantage of new features. I will communicate this in the release notes. You can still use older versions of G.U.I.D.E with older versions of Godot, but you might miss out on new features or bug fixes. I don't have the bandwidth to support multiple versions of this addon for multiple Godot versions. So, in general, neither features nor bugfixes will be backported to older versions. In case of a critical bug that affects a large number of users, I might consider backporting a fix to an older version. Expect this to happen only in exceptional cases.

## Support

You can report issues or ask for help in the [GitHub issue tracker]({{site.issue_tracker}}). Questions about how to use the plugin are marked with the `Knowledge` label, so you can [filter]({{site.issue_tracker}}?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aknowledge%20) for them to find answers for questions that others have asked already.
